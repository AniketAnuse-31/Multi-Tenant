# Multi-Tenant
Develop a Django-based prototype application demonstrating a multi-tenant architecture with four organizational levels: Tenant, Organization, Department, and Customer. The goal is to showcase your ability to design scalable, secure, and well-structured Django applications with data isolation and hierarchical access control.
